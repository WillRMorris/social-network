  ## Description
I built this API to demo work on a social media API handling users, posts, and storing the information via a noSQL databse, using mongoDB and mongoose

  ## Installation
    you clan clone this repo to interact with it

  ## Usage
  this software has CRUD functionality for both Users and a system of posts called Thoughts, along with a system for storing friends and thoughts belonging to a user through arrays of ids, and a system of reactions to thoughts, limited in size and stored as a subdoc. to intergrate into a front end you will need to copy the code files into a repo, and ensure you use the proper syntax when calling.
